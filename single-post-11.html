                              <p>Austin Richard Post, more known as Post Malone or Posty is famous rapper and singer from US. The main cause of his glow up is his vocal abilities. He admitted that he used a lot autotune, however it does not make any sense for his fans. For last decade, in 15th he boomed as high as possible. 'White Inverson' and 'Rockstar' were that songs that blew him up so far. That songs had almost more than 700 million views on YouTube. The song that made him a GOAT is as song about people that underestimated him, it's called 'Congratulations'. It has over a billion views on YouTube and was a number one song at that days. </p>

                              <p>He was born in July 4, 1995 and his father was a DJ that, mixed different genres like rock, country and hip-hop. It proves that he was inspired by his father to mix the genres. His songs don't have any exact genre. For instance his song 'Take What You Want' from last album was a mix of guitar solo by Ozzy Ozzy Osbourne and hip-hop rapping style of Travis Scott. It was one of the most extraordinal songs at that time. The outlook of Austin itself doesn't remind a rapper, his fans claim that he is a mix of wealthy person and homeless, rapper and hard rock musician. That fan is me. Personally, I think that he is my number one musician of all time.

                         <p>Lots of people that he is not as good as he used to be. That is actually not true. The prove is his song 'Circles' that is in top 10 in 'HOT 100 of Billboard' (https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100) for 30 weeks and his last album 'Hollywood's Bleeding' is one of the best albums in Billboard 'Top 200'(https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200). Also Post Malone is the number 4 artist of all time by Billboard while Billie Eilish is number 6 (https://www.billboard.com/charts/artist-100).</p>

                                        <p>The slight rise of fame of Post Malone is defenitely worthy becouse of his talent, devotion and labour of himself. Not everyone can become a Gold Of All Time for a little time as Austin. In addition to it it is not a merit of his tattoos, however it does make sense.</p>
