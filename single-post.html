                              <h3>Biography</h3>
                              <p>    Talking about himself, Stephen Edwin King was born September 21, 1947, in Portland, Maine. In the early years, the writer was left without a father. His father was burdened by family life because of which he went out for cigarettes and did not return. Mother grew up her children (the writer had a half-brother) as she could: asked for help from relatives, often moved, worked at low-paid jobs and barely made ends meet. Due to frequent relocations and weak immunity, Stephen had a long time suffering from illnesses and because of that he remained to second year in first grade. In his free time he loved to read books and comics of Marvel and DC as well, also he loved to watch movies.  To distract from illness, he began to write stories, and at the age of 7 he wrote his first story, although most of the text was rewritten from books and comics. He and his brother published their own newspaper which was named "Dave's Rag". His brother Dave was responsible for local news, while Stephen wrote reviews of television shows and also published his stories.
                               He was a troubled teenager at school, mocked teachers a lot and because of what he was nearly expelled. In 1966, King graduated from high school and entered the University of Maine, where he met his future wife - Tabitha Spruce. In 1970, King graduated from the university with a bachelor's degree, and he was found unfit for military service.
                                In 1971, King marries Tabitha. In the fall of the same year, he began working as an English teacher at a school in Hampden. His wife found a draft of "Carrie", which King found unsuccessful, in the dumpster, and insisted that King finish it. In 1974,  publishing house Doubleday published the novel "Carrie", for which King received an advance of $ 2,500. The publisher then sold the "Carrie" copyright to NAL for $ 400,000, of which King received half, which allowed him to quit his job at school. This was his first successful job, after which writing career went with a bang, all his next books and novels were well received by the public. </p>

                                        <p>Stephen King is the author with whom I began to read, if it were not for his book "Pet Sematary" which interested me, I would not be familiar with the concept of reading in principle. I'm not saying that you need to start or read only Stephen King, I want to say that you need to find that book and that author who will bring you into the world of books. For me, Stephen King became such an author.</p>
